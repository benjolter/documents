# Cash Flow-Based Lending

Consider’s borrower’s present cash flows, loan amount is  based on the capacity of the borrower to repay, repayment schedule is based on the borrower’s timing of cash flows, collateral is not the primary consideration Ex. Microenterprise loans, salary loans, business loans

Advantages: default due to fund diversion minimized, loan size, terms and repayment based on borrower’s cash flow, best suited for short-term, working capital loans

Disadvantages: conservative loan sizes, initially, could work against low-income clients, not the best tool for determining loan requirement of projects needing capital expenditures or long-term investment
