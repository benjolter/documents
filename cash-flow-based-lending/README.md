# Cash Flow-Based Lending

This considers the borrower’s present cash flows, loan amount is based on the capacity of the borrower to repay the loan. The repayment schedule is based on the borrower’s timing of cash flows, collateral is not the primary consideration. Some examples of this are microenterprise loans, salary loans, business loans.

Advantages: Default due to fund diversion minimized, loan size, terms and repayment based on borrower’s cash flow, best suited for short-term, working capital loans.

Disadvantages: Loan size may be conservative as it is relative to repayment capacity, this could work against lower-income earners or people who may be asset rich, without significant cash-flow revenue.
