# Joltify Chain Techs

Joltify is the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) based proof-of-stake public blockchain which is built on cosmos.  Thanks to the high throughput of cosmos blockchain network,  Joltify has a high transaction throughput while preserving the asset safety on chain.&#x20;

Joltify chain is  built on 11 active validators which generate and broadcast the blocks to the network.  Validators who participants in the block generation will be paid by the transaction fee plus the incentives emitted from the Joltify project.&#x20;

The section of the validators are based on the total Jolt they staked plus the age as the validation. The details of the validators election can be found in the section **XXX**.

To maintain the health of the Joltify chain, a punishment policy is introduced to the system to penalise the validators who performs negatively in the Joltify chain. The  misbehaviour validators may be sent to jail (which stop them from get Joltify chain rewards) for a certain amount of time or even face the risk of their deposit.

Joltify also welcomes the investors who do not have enough Jolt to run a validaror. These nodes can delegate their Jolty to one of the active validator  and get the Joltify rewards once their delegated validators participants in block generation.
