JOLTIFY was developed to disrupt the traditional financial world. We feel that there is a need and opportunity for Joltify to create a hybrid bridged environment between real world and digital lending through the use of NFTs and our very own blockchain technology.

In the next chapter, we will give three examples of how and when Joltify can be utilized to bridge the gap between DeFi and traditional finance.

So, let's go ahead and demonstrate how real-world assets can be tokenized into NFT's and how JOLTIFY will facilitate this.
