## 3. Add the Ethereum Mock Chain to the MetaMask Wallet

To facilitate the testing of the bridging function offered by the Joltify testnet, we have introduced an Ethereum mock chain. Users wishing to test this bridging functionality need to connect the Ethereum mock chain with their MetaMask wallet by following the steps outlined below.

1. **Install the MetaMask Wallet Extension**: Begin by downloading the MetaMask Wallet extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. **Set Up Your Wallet**: Once installed, you can either create a new wallet or import existing wallets into MetaMask.
3. **Add the Ethereum Mock Chain**: Finally, add an Ethereum mock chain to your MetaMask wallet for testing and development purposes.
   1. **Click** the network button located at the top-left corner of the interface and **Select** the "Add network" button to initiate the process of adding a customised network.\

      1. (customisable) **Network name**: ETH Mock Chain
      2. **New RPC URL**: [http://65.109.48.184:8545](http://65.109.48.184:8545)
      3. **Chain ID**: 1337
      4. (customisable) **Currency symbol**: ETH
4.  **Import ERC20 Tokens**: Complete your setup by importing the mock ERC20 tokens into your MetaMask wallet.

    1. To add test tokens such as USDT or USDC, simply click on "Import Tokens".
    2. Once you provide the token address, the details such as the token symbol and decimals will be automatically filled.
       1. JOLT-USDT: 0xCB4471f0FBE3d66ad0b9A629606C6509A80612d6
