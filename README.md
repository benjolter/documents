# Introduction To JOLTIFY

### What Is JOLTIFY

JOLTIFY is a unique, custom-built, Cosmos based blockchain technology that aims to bridge real world assets to the decentralized finance world.

JOLTIFY is designed to amalgamate the immense amount of liquidity in the crypto world to real world financial assets. Thus creating seamless synergies between the DeFi and traditional finance world.

Participants within the JOLTIFY chain can benefit in different ways, including but not limited to:

* Providing liquidity for real world projects.
* Providing liquidity for the Jolt pool and within the public pools.
* Staking their Jolt to operate as a validator for the Joltify chain.
* Staking their Jolt in order to delegate an active validator and thus generating the Joltify chain blocks.
