# Project-Based Lending

A method of cash flow lending, which is based on the future or expected cash flows of the project or activity to be financed

&#x20;Collateral is of secondary consideration, primary consideration is the viability of the project

Advantages: repayment is based on future flow of the project, start-ups projects may qualify, best suited for development

Disadvantages: highly prone to diversion of loan proceeds by borrower, highly vulnerable to various project risks, require extensive analysis on feasibility/viability of the project
