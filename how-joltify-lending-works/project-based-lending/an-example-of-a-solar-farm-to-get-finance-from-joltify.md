# An Example Of A Solar Farm To Get Finance From Joltify

The sponsors create a project company Solar Power Plant  LLC via equity shareholder agreement. Solar Power Plant is the operation entity. There are three parts of the business:

* [ ] Preparation:stage dealing with host government legal system, property rights, permits, concession agreements
* [ ] Daily operation: construction, equipment, operation and maintenance contracts
* [ ] Major business strategy decisions: off-take agreement(PPA)

1\. Preparation:stage dealing with host government legal system, property rights, permits, concession agreements

&#x20;2\. Daily operation: construction, equipment, operation and maintenance contracts

3\. Major business strategy decisions: off-take agreement(PPA)

In a PPA, a solar purchaser or “off-taker” buys power from a project developer at a negotiated rate for a specified term without taking ownership of the system.

The intention of this agreement is to provide the project company with stable and sufficient revenue to pay its project debt obligation, cover the operating costs and provide certain required return to the sponsors.
