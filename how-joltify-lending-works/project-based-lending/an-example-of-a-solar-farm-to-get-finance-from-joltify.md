# An Example Of A Solar Farm To Get Finance From Joltify

The sponsors create a project company Solar Power Plant  LLC via equity shareholder agreement. Solar Power Plant is the operation entity. There are three parts of the business:

* [ ] Preparation:stage dealing with host government legal system, property rights, permits, concession agreements
* [ ] Daily operation: construction, equipment, operation and maintenance contracts
* [ ] Major business strategy decisions: off-take agreement(PPA)

In a PPA, a solar purchaser or “off-taker” buys power from a project developer at a negotiated rate for a specified term without taking ownership of the system.

The intention of this agreement is to provide the project company with stable and sufficient revenue to pay its project debt obligation, cover the operating costs and provide certain required return to the sponsors.

Once the off-take agreement is done, It is guaranteed the case flow return. This project company Solar Power Plant LLC can work with an asset originator, which normally will be a funds company specialized in project finance.  This AO company will set up a special purpose vehicle company. The purpose of special purpose vehicle is risk sharing, securitization. Just By creating a Special Purpose Vehicle, the lender can separate the loans from the other obligations it has in the securities. ** **This SPV, therefore, allows its investors to receive monetary benefits before any other debtors or stakeholders of the company.

Now the SPV can tokenize this real-world asset, the expected cash flow guaranteed by the off-take agreement for the Solar Power Plant LLC  via NFT as collateral.  The NFT is minted based on the document created and shared in the Joltify Chain. The price of the NFT, financing fees and financing amount are determined by on-chain pricing mechanism or off-chain mechanism, e.g. "Oracles".  Once these terms are determined, the SPV can get access to the financing from Joltify investors via locked NFT.   At the repayment of the financing, the NFT is unlocked and transferred back to SPV/Asset Originator.   tt
