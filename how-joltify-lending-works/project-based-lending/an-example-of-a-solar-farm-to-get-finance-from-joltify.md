# An Example Of A Solar Farm To Get Finance From Joltify

In a PPA, a solar purchaser or “offtaker” buys power from a project developer at a negotiated rate for a specified term without taking ownership of the system.

The intention of this agreement is to provide the project company with stable and sufficient revenue to pay its project debt obligation, cover the operating costs and provide certain required return to the sponsors.
