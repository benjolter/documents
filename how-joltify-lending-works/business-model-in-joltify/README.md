# Business Model In JOLTIFY

In this chapter, we explain how the project tokenizes the real world finance requirement and how the investors invest their money into the system, to get their fixed APY from the projects.

## Capital Raise & Lending

We give a high-level description of how the verified investors can lend the money to the project. [Three different users cases](../user-cases.md) have been set up to demonstrate how capital raising and lending works in the JOLTIFY network.

1. In order to utilize the liquidity in the crypto world, the project needs to sign a contract with the SPV to agree on the amount of the money it wants to raise, as well as the interest the project needs to pay and the length of the lending.
2. The SPV will then list the lending request on JOLTIFY chain stating the details of this project.
3. During a specific time window, the verified investors sign the contract with the SPV to offer the liquidity for this project.
4. The tokenized document is minted and transferred to the investor.

### Project Repayment
