# Utilization of Joltify in different lending environments

Joltify was developed to disrupt the traditional financial world. We feel that there is a need and opportunity for Joltify to create a hybrid bridged enviroment between real-world and digital lending through the use of NFT's and our very own blockchain technology.&#x20;

In the next chapter, we will give three examples of how and when Joltify can be utlised to bridge the gap between DeFi and traditional finance.&#x20;

So, let's go ahead and demonstrate how real-world assets can be tokenized into NFT's and how Joltify will facilitate this.&#x20;
