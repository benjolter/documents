Technologies have reshaped the world, especially so, in the last two decades. Its innovation and accessibility has transformed our society. It changes the way people communicate, learn, think and live. Weâ€™ve seen the rise of Fintech technology and the inception of AI. Despite this, the financial world seems to continue with elements of its archaic past, it seems that the lending world has currently failed to evolve. Large institutions continue to dominate the market. Large businesses have been served well to the liquid markets with the cost of capital as low as an average of 1%. SMEs, however, still have to pay as high as 15% for the borrowing cost while non-performing loans as low as an average of 2%.
