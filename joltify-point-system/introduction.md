# Introduction

The Joltify point system is designed to encourage participants to integrate with the Joltify ecosystem and promote the Joltify airdrop. The distribution of airdrop rewards will be directly proportional to the points each user has accumulated. After the launch of the Joltify mainnet, participants will be able to claim their airdrop rewards, which will be distributed in the form of JOLT tokens on the Joltify mainnet.

_**\*We reserve the right to modify or adjust the rules pertaining to our airdrop program at our discretion, to accommodate changing circumstances or unforeseen situations.**_
